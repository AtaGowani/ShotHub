    <p class="problem">
      Are you able to find your vaccination record since childhood? Do you remember the last time
      you got your tetanus shot, and when are you due for a booster? Didnâ€™t think so, neither did we. <br>
      <br>
      ShotHub will compile data for patients no matter where the vaccination was administered, and we will create an
      electronic immunization card, that way patients records will be stored in one place.
